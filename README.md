## 📝 **Introduction**

In this project, the goal was to analyze customer data from a bank and determine whether a customer is likely to churn within the next six months.  
Churn refers to when a customer stops using the bank’s services, which can have a significant financial impact on the institution.

We utilize machine learning techniques to predict churn by leveraging customer demographics, account details, and transaction history.
